          <p>Boston Public Schools serve over 54,000 students across their 125 schools. Of these 125 schools, only 52 have their own fully 
            operational libraries. In 2021, former BPS superintendent Dr. Brenda Cassellius created a plan to have fully functioning libraries 
            in all schools by 2026. Cassellius would announce her resignation 3 months later.  </p>

          <p> Literacy is a constant problem in schooling, one that is only made worse from insufficient access to proper reading materials which 
            support early level phonics and reading comprehension skills. There are 192 underfunded schools in the state of Massachusetts which 
            primarily serve communities of color, 65 of which are in the city of Boston. These schools are disproportionately affected by a lack 
            of books at students’ disposal, widening the educational gap in the city.</p>

    <p> This lack of funding in schools means that students of color continue to face educational disparity despite a world that claims equality 
      for all. Underfunded schools <a href="https://libslide.org/data-tools/custom-search/?saved=25g0">lack staff</a>, resources, and materials which have become standards in modern education. Many of these schools are 
      without libraries, and those that have libraries tend to lack full time librarians to en courage reading in children.

      <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/20305448"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20305448/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="chart visualization" /></noscript></div>


<p> These schools are plagued with a lack of access to books, namely books that feature diverse characters, challenges, and languages. 
  “It’s really about accessibility and knowledge. If you don't have a book to read and you don't have the skills to read the book, you won’t even 
  look at it.” Courtney Tipping-Brady, an educator with 17 years of experience who is currently a program director of ELA programs at BPS stressed 
  the importance of pushing diverse books into schools in the Boston area, to encourage reading for all students, and provide ESL students with 
  books that feature their own characters, stories, and worlds that are otherwise overlooked in popular media. </p>

<p>Another significant problem facing literacy rates in the city of Boston is family structure and an evolving world with educational systems that 
  have not kept up with shifts in social structures. Namely, the 40 hour work week. Tipping-Brady stated “There's just less and less village 
  supporting people, so less and less people interacting with kids in little moments of ‘let's read.’ It's really bigger than the literacy moment. 
  It's the whole idea of where and who are with the kids.” She stressed how difficult it has become for parents to support their children’s early 
  reading development because of how different parenting has become in the last 50 years. The school structure was created with the idea that 
  someone remained in the home to help raise the children. Nowadays, both parents work 40 hours a week, leaving less time for at-home reading 
  comprehension and phonetic skills development for young children.</p>

<p> Tipping-Brady detailed how impactful parents with dedicated time to inspire reading in children can be, as early level phonics are primarily 
  developed through reading comprehension and discussion about reading material. “Students can have conversations with their family about books, 
  whether they’re speaking in Spanish or in English. Then the kids are like, oh, cool, mom and dad want to talk to me about this, I should make 
  sure I'm reading about it in school. so I can come back and have a conversation with them about it.”</p> 

<p> There are many programs within the BPS network that seek to mend the divide in reading and phonetic abilities for students, such as Sora, 
  which is a website used by BPS to provide their students with popular e-books in multiple languages. However, a smart device and internet access 
  are required to access Sora, making it difficult for low-income students to access this reading material outside of school. </p>
      
  <p> Similarly, everyone in Massachusetts is entitled to receive a public library card. However, there are a few problems that arise when 
    discussing libraries and their accessibility for students. Children 12 and under are able to receive a library card in person with the 
    signature of a parent or guardian, though that assumes that their parent or guardian is able to make time in the day to bring their child to a 
    library and sign off on their card. For anyone 13 and older, photo ID and proof of residence are required to receive a library card, something 
    that many 13 year olds don’t have immediate access to, and once again would need the assistance of a parent or guardian to receive access to 
    the library. When they do receive their card, it is a matter of being able to make it to the public library, which for many students will at 
    the very least include a bus ride, which costs money that their family may be unable to spare.  </p>

    <p>Despite an ever-evolving world with increased access to transportation and infrastructure, it has become increasingly difficult to get kids 
      to school, let alone to pick them up after school and bring them to practice, libraries, parks, etc. COVID has only made this problem more 
      challenging, as Tipping-Brady commented that “Parents no longer trust the school system, or parents had a negative school experience 
      themselves. If you miss the bus and your parents don’t have a car and can't afford to get you there, how are you going to get to school? How 
      do you get to the library after school?“ </p>


          <p> Students have lost safe spaces that inspire reading, and a passion for literacy has seen a hit because of that. Books in many of these
             schools that lack funding must stay within the classroom, and the stories are outdated and don’t represent diverse classes of students.
            Books which reflect the upper-class experience, which students in those 65 underfunded schools in Boston are unable to relate to.</p>

<p>One cause which seeks to provide students with a diverse abundance of books is On The Same Page Boston, a college-classroom driven (unofficial) 
  nonprofit program that works to supply classrooms in the city of Boston with books. Created by Cathryn Edelstein in 2019 to provide Emerson 
  College with a course on nonprofit fundraising management, OTSPB has provided roughly 7,000 books to seven schools in the BPS system. </p>

<p>Edelstein’s extensive connections through her work as a communications specialist and professor of communications at Emerson College opened 
  doors for the program to propel itself through the BPS system, namely through Cory McCarthy, the Chief of Student Support at BPS. Edelstein 
  described McCarthy as a person who “Works every weekend, all day, every day, doing everything he can to change the community for the better.” 
  He and the superintendent's office have taken over the school selection process for OTSPB, ensuring that the books from the program are making 
  it to students who truly need them. </p>

  <p>This year, OTSPB will be collecting books for the Mather School. Mather is the oldest public elementary school in the country, as well as a 
    school which provides a Vietnamese bilingual education program. The Mather School is located in the C-11 district of Boston, a community that 
    is often faced with high poverty rates and rising crime, according to the Boston Police Department. Mather serves an incredibly diverse student 
    body, with nearly 70% of the student population being African American or Asian descent. One of the primary goals of OTSPB is providing this 
    incredibly diverse community with books where each child is able to see themselves in the stories they read.</p>

    <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/20305747"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20305747/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="chart visualization" /></noscript></div>


    <p>Diversity in books and bilingual stories are something that Edelstein strives to provide to students through the program, stating 
      “BPS is incredibly diverse. For literacy, if young kids don't see themselves in the books, their self esteem drops and their interest in 
      reading drops. If they can see characters, protagonists, with similar journeys and identities to theirs they are more inclined to reading.”</p>
  
      <p>“We are trying to feed into growing literacy with an interest in reading for kids.“ Says Edelstein. The program hopes to provide diverse 
        stories to the students to bolster an interest in reading through like-characters. Edelstein explained this through the theory of windows 
        and doors, saying “A lot of kids always look out the window reading books about others, but you need books that are mirrors that reflect 
        yourself. All kids need that. If you never see a book with yourself, you don’t matter. You don’t count. So this changes the landscape of 
        that, it provides windows and doors in all stories.”</p>

        <p> Cory McCarthy and current BPS superintendent Mary Skipper attended the 2023 OTSPB launch, meeting the students involved in running the 
          program, as well as speaking with the teacher and students who would be receiving the books that year. This kind of show of support give
           evidence to the work that the program is doing outside of the incredible work they have done getting books to students. The program is 
           known and supported by the highest people in the BPS system, and Edelstein said she hopes this kind of support could lead to 
           “A potential conference for others to come in to share the program around.”</p>

           <p> There are systemic roadblocks in place that prevent OTSPB from branching out further, namely its inability to officially call itself a 
            non-profit organization. Since Emerson College is considered a non-profit, OTSPB is unable to organize as such because it is run through an 
            Emerson College class. If the program were to break off from Emerson and operate independently it would be able to operate as a non-profit, 
            however would undermine a few key details. Firstly, Edelstein created the program as a way to educate students in non-profit organization 
            management. Secondly and arguably the most important is money and support. The program functions through fresh eyes every semester that operate 
            the program under the guidance of Edelstein. Since it is a course-based program, there is a constant flow of support to ensure the program 
            continues year after year. However, if broken away from Emerson, it may be difficult to muster support to run the program, as well as find the 
            money to do so. </p>

            <p> “I have grand ideas, and if I could wave a wand, I would push this program to different cities across the united states. It is a 
              win-win for students and communities. At this point I have good methods that are successful, my students are excited about it, and 
              that also energizes the campaign.” Edelstein said.</p>

              <p> On The Same Page Boston launched its Fall 2024 campaign on November 5th, with the students running the program meeting the 
                children at the Mather School via Zoom. Edelstein and her students had a decorated poster board prepared for the students and 
                spoke with them for around 40 minutes before the children had to go back to class. They concluded the meeting with a countdown for 
                the launch of the program, followed by cheers and thanks from the students. </p>

        <p> From continued support from previous years, 16 books had already been purchased for the students before the launch. “People are aware 
          of the disparity. People are aware of it, and we see success because people care.” Edelstein said. </p>

      <p> One question asked by an OTSPB student was what the students’ favorite subjects are, and what books they would like to receive. This 
        question seemed to resonate the most with the students, as every student’s hand launched into the air, many blurting their answers out 
        before being called on. Here is what some of them said.</p>

        <p>“I like to read about cooking, my dream job is to be a cook. My mom said one day I can be a good cook because I know how to make 
          sandwiches. I want to make cakes and I like to make things with dough, like pizza, cake, doughnuts.”</p>

          <p> “My favorite subject is recess.”</p>

          <p>“My favorite subject is science, learning about spiders. They can create different webs and different types of webs. Orb spiders, 
            orb webs.”</p>

            <p>“I like drama because there is a lot of drama and there is like, drama.”</p>

            <p>In response to the excitement of the class, teacher Deborah Foley calmed the students, saying they would receive “Football books,
               superhero books, books in Vietnamese, all books I hope you will enjoy.”</p>

               
                <p> “It's not expensive to make a difference. For the price of a cup of coffee you can buy an inexpensive book and send it to 
                  a school. It’s not just for this grade, but these books will stay in schools for generations.” said Edelstein.</p>
